# **GENIUS TRIVIA QUIZ**

You can see the live site [here](https://amartins87.github.io/Genius_Trivia_Quiz/).

The purpose of Genius Trivia Quiz is to test user's general knowledge through a variety of questions. 

I kept the site simple containing only a background image with a back up background color of black in case the image doesn't load up for a good contrast.

## **FUTURE DEVELOPMENT**

I would like to add pop up modals with interesting facts about the correct answers. Also I would like to add a question counter and a timer. 

## **TESTING**

As you can see in my [wireframes](assets/wireframes/Makaton_wireframe_all.png), the layout was originally planned slightly differently, including the position and display of a navbar. 

I kept the styling of the game to a minimum to make it accessible and easy to navigate through on every device. 

I tested every page in Chrome Developer Tools using responsive design as well as all of the available device types listed. 

I tested every page on iPad and iPhone 8, and I asked my friends and family to test the site on their mobile devices (Huawei, Xiaomi Redmi, and Samsung). They confirmed the quiz functioned well on their devices.

I tested the website in Chrome and Microsoft Edge on my desktop PC with widescreen (screen resolution of 1920px by 1080px), and tested it on a laptop in Chrome, Mozilla, and Microsoft Edge. The site is responsive, looks good, content is readable on all standard screen sizes and I found it easy to click on all buttons. 

### **VALIDATOR TESTING**

-   **HTML** (No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator

### **ACCESSIBILITY**

I checked that the chosen colors and fonts are easy to read. All pages have passed through  the Lighthouse reporting tool in Chrome developer tools on both mobile and desktop.

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:

2.  From the **Source** section drop-down menu, select the **Branch:main**
3.  Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
