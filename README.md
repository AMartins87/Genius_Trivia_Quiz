## **FUTURE DEVELOPMENT**

I would like to add pop-up modals with interesting facts about the correct answers. I would also like to add a question counter and a timer. 

## **TESTING**

Here are my [Balsamiq wireframes](assets/wireframes/Balsamiq_wireframe.JPG). 

I kept the styling of the quiz to a minimum to make it accessible and easy to navigate through on every device without the need for media queries. I set a simple background image with a backup background color of black for a good contrast in case the image doesn't load up.

I tested the uiz in Chrome Developer Tools using responsive design as well as all of the available device types listed. 

I tested the quiz on an iPad and iPhone 8, in Chrome and Microsoft Edge on my desktop PC with a screen resolution of 1920px by 1080px. I also tested the quiz on a laptop in Chrome, Mozilla, and Microsoft Edge. The site is responsive, looks good, content is readable on all standard screen sizes and I found it easy to click on all buttons after the padding got increased.

### **VALIDATOR TESTING**

-   **HTML** (No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator)
